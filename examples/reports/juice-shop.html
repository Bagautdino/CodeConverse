        <tr><td>juice-shop/models/wallet.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>The code exposes a potential SQL injection vulnerability through the `UserId` field, as it directly uses user input without proper sanitization.  <br></td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/recycle.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH <br><br>The provided code has no major security vulnerabilities but does not include input validation or sanitization for user-provided data which could lead to potential SQL injection or data corruption issues.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/securityQuestion.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: LOW<br><br>The code defines a Sequelize model for a 'SecurityQuestion' entity, which appears to be a simple database table with an auto-incrementing 'id' and a 'question' field, but it lacks any significant security vulnerabilities or secrets, as it only uses standard Sequelize features and does not expose any sensitive information.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/challenge.ts</td><td>safe</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/basketitem.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH <br><br>The code defines a Sequelize model for BasketItem with four columns (ProductId, BasketId, id, and quantity) but lacks input validation and sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/complaint.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>This code contains a potential SQL injection vulnerability due to the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user input, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries and potentially compromise the security of the application.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/quantity.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: CRITICAL. The code contains a potential SQL injection vulnerability due to the use of Sequelize ORM, which, if not properly sanitized, can lead to security issues.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/product.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br>The code contains a critical vulnerability in the description field where it fails to sanitize user input, potentially allowing XSS attacks, especially in the context of the restfulXssChallenge.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/basket.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br>The code defines a Sequelize model for a 'Basket' that includes a 'coupon' field which may contain sensitive coupon codes and a 'UserId' field that could potentially expose user associations if not properly handled.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/captcha.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH <br><br>The code exposes sensitive information by directly storing the captcha answer in plain text within the database. <br><br><br></td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/card.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>The provided code snippet contains sensitive data, including credit card information (card number, expiration month and year), and lacks proper encryption and security measures to protect this data.<br><br>Here are some key vulnerabilities and concerns:<br><br>1. **Unencrypted credit card data**: The code stores credit card numbers in plain text, which is a serious security risk. Credit card numbers should be encrypted and stored securely.<br><br>2. **Lack of validation for card numbers**: Although the code validates the card number to ensure it is an integer and within a certain range, it does not validate the card number format (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Amex).<br><br>3. **No security measures for sensitive data**: The code does not implement any security measures to protect sensitive data, such as encryption, access controls, or secure storage.<br><br>4. **Potential for SQL injection**: Although the code uses Sequelize, which provides some protection against SQL injection, it is still possible to inject malicious SQL code if user input is not properly sanitized.<br><br>To address these concerns, consider the following:<br><br>1. **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use a secure encryption algorithm to encrypt credit card numbers and other sensitive data.<br><br>2. **Implement secure storage**: Store encrypted data in a secure storage solution, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a secure key-value store.<br><br>3. **Validate user input**: Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and ensure that data is properly formatted.<br><br>4. **Implement access controls**: Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users can view or modify this data.<br><br>Here's an updated example that demonstrates how to encrypt credit card numbers using a simple encryption algorithm:<br>```javascript<br>import * as crypto from 'crypto';<br><br>class Card extends Model<<br>InferAttributes<Card>,<br>InferCreationAttributes<Card><br>> {<br>  declare UserId: number<br>  declare id: CreationOptional<number><br>  declare fullName: string<br>  declare cardNum: string // encrypted card number<br>  declare expMonth: number<br>  declare expYear: number<br>}<br><br>const CardModelInit = (sequelize: Sequelize) => {<br>  Card.init(<br>    {<br>      UserId: {<br>        type: DataTypes.INTEGER<br>      },<br>      id: {<br>        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,<br>        primaryKey: true,<br>        autoIncrement: true<br>      },<br>      fullName: DataTypes.STRING,<br>      cardNum: {<br>        type: DataTypes.STRING, // encrypted card number<br>        validate: {<br>          isString: true,<br>          len: [16, 16] // 16-digit card number<br>        }<br>      },<br>      expMonth: {<br>        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,<br>        validate: {<br>          isInt: true,<br>          min: 1,<br>          max: 12<br>        }<br>      },<br>      expYear: {<br>        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,<br>        validate: {<br>          isInt: true,<br>          min: 2080,<br>          max: 2099<br>        }<br>      }<br>    },<br>    {<br>      tableName: 'Cards',<br>      sequelize<br>    }<br>  )<br>}<br><br>// Encrypt card number before saving<br>const encryptCardNumber = (cardNumber: string) => {<br>  const encryptionKey = 'your_encryption_key_here';<br>  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);<br>  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey, iv);<br>  const encryptedCardNumber = Buffer.concat([cipher.update(cardNumber), cipher.final()]);<br>  return iv.toString('hex') + ':' + encryptedCardNumber.toString('hex');<br>};<br><br>// Decrypt card number before retrieving<br>const decryptCardNumber = (encryptedCardNumber: string) => {<br>  const encryptionKey = 'your_encryption_key_here';<br>  const parts = encryptedCardNumber.split(':');<br>  const iv = Buffer.from(parts.shift(), 'hex');<br>  const encryptedData = Buffer.from(parts.join(':'), 'hex');<br>  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-cbc', encryptionKey, iv);<br>  const decryptedCardNumber = Buffer.concat([decipher.update(encryptedData), decipher.final()]);<br>  return decryptedCardNumber.toString();<br>};<br><br>// Example usage:<br>const card = new Card({<br>  fullName: 'John Doe',<br>  cardNum: encryptCardNumber('1234567890123456'),<br>  expMonth: 12,<br>  expYear: 2099<br>});<br><br>// Retrieve and decrypt card number<br>const decryptedCardNumber = decryptCardNumber(card.cardNum);<br>console.log(decryptedCardNumber); // Output: 1234567890123456<br>```<br>Note that this is a simplified example and you should consider using a more secure encryption algorithm and key management strategy in a real-world application.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/relations.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>The code defines a complex database schema using Sequelize, establishing relationships between various models, but it contains potential security vulnerabilities and secrets due to the lack of input validation, missing foreign key constraints for some associations, and the use of a deprecated `makeKeyNonUpdatable` function.<br><br>A potential security risk is the missing foreign key constraint for the `FeedbackModel` association with `UserModel`, which could allow anonymous feedback posts. Additionally, the `makeKeyNonUpdatable` function is used to make certain keys non-updatable, but its implementation is not provided, and it may contain security vulnerabilities.<br><br>Furthermore, the code does not handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during database operations, which could lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/privacyRequests.ts</td><td>safe</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/feedback.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: CRITICAL<br><br>The code contains a critical vulnerability to persisted cross-site scripting (XSS) due to the use of `security.sanitizeHtml(comment)` which is inadequate to prevent XSS attacks, and a potential secret in the `security` module, which may contain insecure functions.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/imageCaptcha.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>The code defines a Sequelize model for ImageCaptcha, which stores user images and answers, but it lacks any form of authentication or authorization, allowing an attacker to potentially manipulate or access sensitive user data without proper permissions.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/memory.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: CRITICAL. This code defines a Memory model for a database using Sequelize, with fields for user ID, ID, caption, and image path, and initializes the model with a table name of "Memories".</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/index.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>The code contains multiple vulnerabilities and secrets, including direct database credentials, which are exposed and not properly secured, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the database.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/securityAnswer.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br>The code initializes a Sequelize model for security answers that stores HMAC-hashed answers in the 'answer' field, but the HMAC secret used for this purpose is hardcoded in the 'security.hmac' function, posing a risk of unauthorized access if the secret is discovered.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/user.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: CRITICAL <br>The code reveals a weak password hashing method (`security.hash`) and stores sensitive data like TOTP secrets (`totpSecret`) and potentially email addresses in plain text.  <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/delivery.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH. <br>This code appears to be a Sequelize model for a 'Delivery' entity, but it lacks input validation and sanitization, potentially exposing the application to SQL injection and data corruption vulnerabilities.<br><br>Here are some potential issues with the code:<br><br>1. **SQL Injection**: The `name`, `price`, `deluxePrice`, `eta`, and `icon` fields are not validated or sanitized, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.<br>2. **Data Corruption**: The `price`, `deluxePrice`, and `eta` fields are defined as `FLOAT`, which could lead to precision issues and data corruption if not handled properly.<br>3. **Missing Indexes**: There are no indexes defined on the `name` field, which could lead to slow query performance if the table grows large.<br>4. **Lack of Error Handling**: The `DeliveryModelInit` function does not handle errors that may occur during model initialization.<br><br>To address these issues, consider adding input validation and sanitization, using more precise data types (e.g., `DECIMAL` instead of `FLOAT`), defining indexes on frequently queried fields, and implementing error handling mechanisms. <br><br>Example of how to add input validation using Sequelize's built-in validation:<br><br>```javascript<br>const DeliveryModelInit = (sequelize: Sequelize) => {<br>  Delivery.init(<br>    {<br>      id: {<br>        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,<br>        primaryKey: true,<br>        autoIncrement: true<br>      },<br>      name: {<br>        type: DataTypes.STRING,<br>        validate: {<br>          notEmpty: true,<br>          len: [3, 50] // adjust length according to your requirements<br>        }<br>      },<br>      price: {<br>        type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2), // use DECIMAL instead of FLOAT<br>        validate: {<br>          isNumeric: true,<br>          min: 0<br>        }<br>      },<br>      deluxePrice: {<br>        type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2),<br>        validate: {<br>          isNumeric: true,<br>          min: 0<br>        }<br>      },<br>      eta: {<br>        type: DataTypes.DECIMAL(10, 2),<br>        validate: {<br>          isNumeric: true,<br>          min: 0<br>        }<br>      },<br>      icon: {<br>        type: DataTypes.STRING,<br>        validate: {<br>          notEmpty: true,<br>          len: [3, 50]<br>        }<br>      }<br>    },<br>    {<br>      tableName: 'Deliveries',<br>      sequelize<br>    }<br>  )<br>}<br>```<br>This code adds basic validation for each field, but you should adjust it according to your specific requirements.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/models/address.ts</td><td>SEVERITY: HIGH<br><br>The code contains several potential vulnerabilities and secrets, including a possible SQL injection risk due to the lack of proper validation and sanitization of user input in the `mobileNum` and `zipCode` fields, and the exposure of a sensitive `UserId` attribute that could potentially be used for unauthorized access or data manipulation.</td></tr><tr><td>juice-shop/views/themes/themes.js</td><td>safe</td></tr>
